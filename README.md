# diff
Python script that compares two HDF5 files. 

Usage:

  python ndiff.py <file-A> <file-B>

or:

  ./ndiff.py <file-A> <file-B>


The script opens two HDF5 files and recursively compares the datasets
and groups in the files. It examines groups, datasets and attributes
and reports if some of these exist in one file and not the other, and
if their names or types differ between the two files. It also reports when there are differences in dataset or attribute values.

When a difference is found, it will report one of the following codes:

	DIFF_UNIQUE_A	 -- a dataset or group only exists in file A

	DIFF_UNIQUE_B	 -- a dataset or group only exists in file B

	DIFF_OBJECTS	 -- an object is a dataset in one file and a group in the other

	DIFF_DTYPE       -- the type of an object is different between files

	DIFF_UNIQ_ATTR_A -- an attribute is only present in file A

	DIFF_UNIQ_ATTR_B -- an attribute is only present in file B

	DIFF_ATTR_DTYPE	 -- the type of an attribute differs between files
	
	DIFF_DATA        -- one or more values in a dataset differs
	
	DIFF_ATTR_VALUE  -- value of an attribute differs


Example (command-line linux):


	keith:~$ ./ndiff.py foo.h5 bar.h5 

	Comparing 'foo.h5' and 'bar.h5'
	------------------------------
	Examining /
		bar5
		bar3
	** Attribute 'a' only in 'bar.h5' (DIFF_UNIQ_ATTR_B)**
		bar2
		bar
		bar4
	**  Different element types: 'group' and 'dataset' (DIFF_OBJECTS)
	------------------------------
	Examining /bar5/
	** Element 'bar7' only in 'foo.h5' (DIFF_UNIQUE_A)**
	** Element 'bar8' only in 'bar.h5' (DIFF_UNIQUE_B)**
		bar6
	** Different dtypes: '<type 'str'>' and '<type 'numpy.ndarray'>' (DIFF_DTYPE)**
